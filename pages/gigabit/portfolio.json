    "Project": "Adagio",
    "Project Summary": "The brainchild of Gig City Production‘s Jonathan Susman, Adagio is a cloud-based remote audio mixing tool co-developed with UTC Computer Science Professor Craig Tannis and several of his graduate students. Utilizing Chattanooga’s gigabit network, Adagio’s cloud-based platform drastically lowers the financial and technological barriers to mixing audio – students and professionals alike have access to studio-quality tools right from their browser.",
    "Outcomes": "Winner of Co.Lab‘s 48-Hour Launch and awarded funding during the Gigabit Community Fund’s first round in 2014, Adagio has since been demoed in London at Mozilla’s annual MozFest as well as at the National Science Foundation’s CyberLearning 2015 conference in Arlington, VA. Jonathan and Adagio also worked with teachers from the Barger Academy of Fine Arts, a magnet school in the Gig City, to develop curricula around the tool; they’ve also been featured during Chattanooga’s Startup Week and the opening of the Public Library’s GigLab. They further participated in GIGTANK 2016.",
    "Gigabit Advantage": "Large single-track music files are stored in the cloud and can be downloaded seemlessly to any user. Low-latency networks solve common issue of sync in music remixing, allows for seemless collaboration across town, and real-time feedback from one user to another working on the same piece of music.",

    "Project Summary": "A collaboration between the Creative Discovery Museum‘s Museum Apprentice Program and developers from Spartan Systems, Inc., Building an App from the Ground, Up is both a platform and toolbox for other education programs. Under the guidance of CDM’s Randy Jestice and James Candan of Spartan System, a group of teen volunteers has researched, designed and built a scavenger hunt app featuring some of the museum’s entomological exhibits.",
    "Outcomes": "In developing this immersive learning tool, the students have done everything from the art elements to programming the game itself; a separate teen A/V team filmed and edited videos of the project while in progress, as well as handling all social media updates and the project blog. In many ways, the MAPs team has evolved into their own development company, serving Chattanooga’s young museum-goers. Funded during the second round of the Gigabit Community Fund, the project demoed at the Mini Maker Faire during Startup Week; a beta version of Critter Catch, their app, is nearing release.",

    "Project Summary": "From a nascent idea for a mobile learn-to-code app, Duncan Ingram, Inc. developers Tim Coy and Jonathan Williams brought devLearn to life at Hackanooga – Chattanooga’s second annual weekend of civic hacking – in July of 2014. The free app, now available for both iOS and Android, offers gamefied lessons in HTML and CSS, with a JavaScript tutorial on the way. One of its chief innovations has been in eliminating the need for typing on a mobile device; asking the user multiple choice questions and to code via drag-and-drop blocks, devLearn takes the frustration of a misplaced period or an errant space out of the programming equation.",
    "Outcomes": "Awarded funding during the second round of the Gigabit Community Fund, devLearn demoed at Chattanooga’s own Mini Maker Faire, as well as the World Maker Faire in Flushing Meadow, NY, before piloting with library students at Clifton Hills Elementary School. devLearn illustrates what the gig’s low-latency and a pair of civic-minded developers can mean to a city: Downloaded more than 1500 times in its first two months, students, parents and teachers throughout Hamilton County (and beyond) are learning how to code for the first time.",
    "Gigabit Advantage": "Media-rich learning enviornments load quickly, with no waiting or lag. This project has also been a great example of how CHA\"s network can compress development and feedback cycles with developers and educators working together in real time to refine the application.",

With the help of Jill Pala, GPS’s Chair of Computer Science, members of the Spanish department and a team of her classmates – as well as support from UTC and TVA – Anjali ran an after-school program focusing on English as a second language and healthier lifestyle skills through app design, developing a publicly-available digital literacy curriculum along the way.",
    "Outcomes": "Pilot participants learned the basics of and built mobile applications over the course of eight weeks, creating versions in both English and Spanish. At a ceremony judged by local developers, each student team presented their completed applications to a packed house – with Mayor Andy Berke handing out awards. Anjali has since received additional funding from Causeway to help continue the project.",

A media-heavy browser application and natural fit for the gig, the Hyperaudio Pad allows users to manipulate and create content by dragging and dropping selections from text and transcripts tied to audio or video files",
    "Outcomes": "Over the course of the first round of support from the Gigabit Community Fund, Hyperlocal Hyperaudio demoed at Maker Partiesin the Bronx and in Chattanooga, as well as at Co.Lab’s GigTankDemo Day in 2014. Justin Hoenke, head of Teen Services for the library, and teachers from the Howard School developed lesson plans around the platform, engaging students in local history while learning through play; future collaboration has been planned with the Hunter Museum of American Art.",
    "Gigabit Advantage": "High-speed, low-latency connections allow videos to compile in seconds, without lag or wait times getting in the way of creating and learning. When demoed in New York, for example, a slower connection meant that videos and remixes took much longer to compile and load, which had a notable negative effect on youth engagement with the application.",

Housed on the celebrated 4th Floor, this second round Gigabit Community Fund project pushes the idea of creation, not just consumption, at the Chattanooga Public Library to more than 1000 Mb/s, and, with equipment ranging from Arduinos demonstrating basic network infrastructure to streaming 4K television, the lab offers an opportunity for patrons to understand just what those speeds mean.",
    "Outcomes": "The GigLab has also been a boon to Chattanooga’s developer community – many other Mozilla Gigabit Fund projects demoed during November’s grand opening – as well as the Open Chattanooga Brigade, who have been been able to utilize the available bandwidth for processing large data sets. Planned future applications include pairing virtual reality headsets with city lidar and GIS data to build immersive educational experiences for younger patrons (a Minecraft-based project being piloted in conjunction with the Kansas City Digital Media Lab) and regular low-latency performances with musicians in other gigabit cities, including Burlington, VE.",

Lead by CSAS’s Davis Mounger and Ashley Patterson-Johnston and Joyce Purdue from Hixson, students designed, built and programmed buoys, monitoring devices and wireless sending-units to collect information from various locations within the North Chickamauga Creek watershed using SparkFun Electronics‘ microcontroller platform. The schools have been collaborating with Dr. Mark Schorr, a professor from the Department of Biological and Environmental Sciences at UTC, where their network is contributing to his decades-long project monitoring regional water pollution, providing streaming data where previously only annual or biannual samplings were practical.",
    "Outcomes": "Originally funded during the second round of the 2014 Gigabit Community Fund, the class was so popular that Hixson has begun offering Wireless Earth Watchdogs as an extracurricular club – the original pilot students serve as mentors – as well as supporting a second semester of the course.",
